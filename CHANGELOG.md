- :pencil2: Doc :hammer: ! Enforce JSDocs on all defined functions
- :pencil2: Doc all current functions to pass the above added test
- :rocket: Strip out dedupe function from split and re-impliment as a `post` function to give the `interpolate` module more signal and also allow further code isolation and testing.

### v11.15.1

- :bug: only discard duplicate house number sets when there is >1km separation between them
- :rocket: of the remaining duplicate house number sets, only geocode the first entry (doing the rest is pointless)

### v11.15.0

- :arrow_up: Adds DocumentationJS as Dev Dep
- :pencil2: Add documentation js linting to circle and fix all bad JSDoc strings

### v11.14.0

- :rocket: Don't pick linker matches arbitrarily, instead return ties to match.js and let it break ties using the buffer geom

### v11.13.0

- :rocket: optionally preserve 'source' attribute from address geojson

### v11.12.2

- :bug: better handling of titlecasing of labels

### v11.12.1

### v11.11.2

- :white_check_mark: Adds the first split unit tests

### v11.11.1

- :arrow_up: Update to latest deps
- :bug: `label` module was uppercases letter after an `'`. IE: `Helen's` => `Helen'S`

### v11.11.0


- :bug: a call to `turf.linestring` failed when passed a one-coordinate feature. This was the result of a call to `dedup()` which was being passed a two-point line of coordinates that had been truncated enough to be identical. `dedup` removed one of them, producing the error. This case is now detected and handled.
- :bug: `split.js` was producing weird errors related to `proc.c` and `InitProcess`. This looked like postgres connection exhaustion. Initially I implemented a system for calling the postgres pool shutdown function. That code remains in place (it's good hygiene!) but was not the issue: instead, the split.js parallelism based on CPU count was the culprit, as each child process instantiated its own postgres connection pool and I was on a 64 core ECS container. Capping the total number of child processes to 16 is inelegant but seems to do the trick.

### v11.10.1

- :rocket: :white_check_mark: Remove the `1/2` from numbers - numbers are deduped if they already exist in the non-`1/2` form.

- :rocket: :white_check_mark: Added concept of post scripts and assoc. tests
- :rocket: Added cardinality post script ie: `S Main St` => `S Main St,Main  ST S`

### v11.8.0

- :rocket: Better readability of `TEXT FAIL` mismatch when in `test` mode
- :arrow_up: Update to latest geocoder-abbr version (1.7.0)
- :rocket: Remove tabs from `test` and fix indentation

### v11.7.1

- :bug: Restore `debug` property on `map` module output when `--debug` is passed

### v11.7.0

- :white_check_mark: Comprehensive tests for strip-unit
- :tada: support `123 B` => `123B` Address conversions (Common in Canada Data)

### v11.6.2

### v11.2.0

- :rocket: Zoom to map bounds on first open of debug

### v11.1.0

- :rocket: uses the callback functionality of `process.stdout.write` to throttle writing so that it only occurs after the previous write is flushed. I don't think this helps but it's not a bad idea.
- :rocket: uses the `split` module in the parent/orchestrating process to (hopefully) only write whole-line chunks to the output file

### v11.0.0

- :rocket: ITP segments are now allowed to exceeds the min/max addresses at the calculated start/end points to get a better range
    - IE: `22 => 96` would potentially become `0 => 100`.
    - Although this doesn't change the output format or cli options the data is drastically different from the 10x series - hence the major version

### v10.0.1

- :bug: `strip` mode - Don't ouput geometry if it was only points - empty array

### v10.0.0

### v9.29.2

- :bug: Retain fallback random `id` to ensure all feats are id'd

### v9.29.1

- :bug: Switch to id calc based on bounds as some geoms have the same centre as houses on the block can have an address

- :rocket: modularizes geocoding capability too
- :tada: adds `--limit` param to `test.js`
- :rocket: weight linker comparisons to deemphasize mismatches based purely on tokens
    - adds `text_tokenless` column to `address_cluster` & `network_cluster` tables
    - handle all-token special case by checking for substring status

### v9.22.1

- :rocket: Remove outdated getNames() call

### v9.22.0

- :rocket: Show street name of viewed feature
- :rocket: Allow searching by lat/lng in search box

### v9.21.1

### v9.18.0

- :tada: Add diacritic handling to both the test mode & std. `street` field
- rocket: Use `address._text` as definitive name and add `network._text` as syn when they differ
- :bug: Make `psv` files in `lib/copy` have unique names so pt2itp can run in parallel

### v9.17.0

- :rocket: Moves token management to a central shared repo

### v9.16.1

- :bug: Fix bug where assignment wouldn't happen even if score > .4

### v9.16.0

- :bug: Allow `debug` mode from any relative path - use to break as `./web` was hardcoded as static dir
- :tada: remove all `freq` calculations and replace with a much more accurate Liechtenstein distance percent.
  - This change is pretty large and will drastically affect matches in all countries.
  - Before matches were calculated by sorting potentials with the calculated frequency of token matches. This worked well if everything was spelled correctly and helped ensure `st` vs `av` errors still lead to a match. It did however also allow things like `Margaret St` and `Shepherd St` to match on the `ST` token alone.
  - This uses lev. dist to generate a percent with a hard cutoff on if the match can take place or not. From a lot of groking the results 40% matches and above seem like a good first start.

- :arrow_up: Update `carmen@22.1.3` and `turf@4.2.0`

### v9.10.0

- :tada: add `stat` module for calculating useful numbers from generated ITP files

### v9.8.0

- :rocket: `debug` mode of interpolation.js now writes to `.debug` property with a node for l/r start/end addresses with `left`, `right`, `start`, `end` boolean properties
           this can optionally be consumed by `debug` mode (makes it farrr more useful than without `--debug` flag)

- :arrow_up: eslint@2.13.1

### v2.8.0
- :tada: qa-tiles map now emits string for single name or array for multiple street names (alternates)
- :rocket: :white_check_mark: generalize `name#tokenizeFeats` and `worker#tokenizeFeats` to single `tokenize#perFeats` & add tests
- :tada: :white_check_mark: `tokenize#perFeats` now handles alternate names by creating duplicate geometries with each name and a list of alternates for each + add tests
